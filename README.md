# Online Test

This is an application to mimic online tests. A user enters their username to begin the test.

## Getting Started

Recommended to use Intellij, cause that was the IDE I used/am using to develop the application.
Note:
To auto-reload the front-end (HTML, JS files) do the following:


 1. File –> Setting –> Build, Execution, Deployment –> Compiler –> check this Build project automatically
 2. Press SHIFT+CTRL+A (Win/Linux) or Command+SHIFT+A (Mac) to open a pop-up windows, type registry
 3. Find and enabled this option `compiler.automake.allow.when.app.running`
 4. Restart IDE
 5. Make changes to HTML or JS & force-build (`CTRL+F9`)
 6. Refresh browser to see changes
 
 Note:
 <br>Use the following url to add file to database from S3:
 /questionfile?file=filename.txt

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
